            <!--Adding an image-->
            <img id="my-image" src="./images/me.jpg" alt="My image" title="My image">

            <p>My name is Dei, and I would like to take this opportunity to share a little bit about myself.
                I was born in 15<sup>th</sup> of December and raised in the Philippines. Growing up in a not
                multicultural town, I was not really exposed to different cultures, until I moved here in Canada.
                When I was 17 I moved here in Canada, after I moved here that is when I got exposed to different
                beliefs, traditions, and values, which made me into a more <b>open minded and accepting person. </b>
                My parent have always pushes me to go anf explore my interest and pursue my dreams, making me more
                determined about what I want in life.
            </p>

            <p>
                I more thing about me is that I love playing sports, as I have played different sports.
                From basketball and soccer to volleybal and badminton, because of this I have explored the physical and
                mental toughness of each games offer.
                When I was in highschool, I played for <abbr title="Sioux North Highschool">SNHS,</abbr> which is my
                highschool team. Throughout my highschool career, I have encountered many challeges, including deafeats
                and self-doubt.
                This challenges fueled my determination to be better and rise above them. The resilience that I
                developed on the field has empowered me to keep going, embracing them as opportunities for personal
                growth. Because of this challenges, I have not only become a stronger athlete but also a more resilient
                person, capable of adapting to any hardships at life.
